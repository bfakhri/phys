// Description of the files of this project


main.cpp	- Contains default glut redefined functions
		- Calls glutmainloop()
		- idle() in specific drives everything outside of the glut main loop

draw.h/cpp	- Contains functions that elaborate on drawing procedures of glut

shape.h/cpp	- Defines the shape class 
		- Need to decide how static (how much functionality) will be in this file

			- Probably the more the better
		- Subclasses of Shape must provide these functions:
			- volume
			- moment of inertia
			- density? 

phys.h/cpp	- Defines the main physics loop that updates the states of all of the shapes
			- Collision detection/resolution etc


mather.h	- Declares structures used for math throughout the project like the cartesian struct

Information pathways:

main ---> phys		// main drives each step of physics loop
			// settings are sent to physics loop such as turning gravity on/off and world-wrapping


main ---> shape ---> draw	// main drive shape which then drives draw (chooses when to refresh frame)
