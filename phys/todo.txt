1) Decide if I can eliminate need for global shape vector
	I can do this by putting allShapes vector in shapes.cpp 
	New call hierarchy:
		main:display() -> shape:drawAll() -> draw:drawShape()
2) Move all shapes elements into shape files
3) Figure out why struct won't work in all_includes.h
4) Try and get rid of all_includes.h

5) Implement physics functions
6) Implement the rest of the files
