5) Implement physics functions
6) Implement the rest of the files
7) Protect certain physics functions from approaching zero and divide by zero conditions
8) Protect loops from integer overflow by changing all ints to specifically sized ints (uint16_t etc)
9) Check math of physics functions

Longer Term
- Maybe add sound? 3D sound of collisions? 
- Make a wiki/better documentation page
- Add inputs to the world by the user: I was thinking an object with accelerometer/magnetometer/orientationMeter 
	could act as an input and a "virtual" version of the object in the engine which can interact with the 
	world's objects
