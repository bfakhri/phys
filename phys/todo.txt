----
5) Implement physics functions
6) Figure out a way to toggle settings like worldWrap elegantly 
	- maybe have each file have an interface function to toggle 
	static global variables that turn those things on/off
7) Implement draw file
7) Protect certain physics functions from approaching zero and divide by zero conditions
8) Protect loops from integer overflow by changing all ints to specifically sized ints (uint16_t etc)
9) Check math of physics functions

Longer Term
- Maybe make the physics able to function backwards too? 
- Maybe add sound? 3D sound of collisions? 
- Make a wiki/better documentation page
- Add inputs to the world by the user: I was thinking an object with accelerometer/magnetometer/orientationMeter 
	could act as an input and a "virtual" version of the object in the engine which can interact with the 
	world's objects
