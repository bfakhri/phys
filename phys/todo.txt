2) Add function for making walls better
3) Add normal force for collisions
4) Maybe we're using the wrong moments of inertia. We may need the moments for the shape about an axis other than its own
	- Maybe use the parallel axis theorem to calculate different types of moments
5) Implement physics functions
6) Figure out a way to toggle settings like worldWrap elegantly 
	- Make advanceSim() function have a ton of parameters for everything. 
		That will be our gateway to the simulator parameters
7) Protect certain physics functions from approaching zero and divide by zero conditions
8) Add color/texture properties to the Shape class, which will be reflected when they are drawn

Longer Term
- Maybe add sound? 3D sound of collisions? 
- Make a wiki/better documentation page
- Add inputs to the world by the user: I was thinking an object with accelerometer/magnetometer/orientationMeter 
	could act as an input and a "virtual" version of the object in the engine which can interact with the 
	world's objects
- Joystick to toggle a vehicle in the "world"?
