----------------------------------

2 Main techniques in Knowledge Based Systems: 
1) Search
2) Pattern Matching


- Inductive Learning
	- Going from examples to generalizations - Search problem
		- Need to determine a START STATE, and GOAL TEST to get to a END STATE (which is a good generalization). 
		- Goal Test Bias - how to choose a generalization from a list of working generalizations
	- Rule learning - trying to cover all cases with rules or rules+exceptions
	- Decision Tree (like 20 questions) - a good decision tree is a small decision tree
		- Smallest tree might be infeasably hard to find
