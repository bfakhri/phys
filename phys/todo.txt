3) Add normal force for collisions hopefully this will fix weird bounce problem
6) Figure out a way to toggle settings like worldWrap elegantly 
	- Make advanceSim() function have a ton of parameters for everything. 
		That will be our gateway to the simulator parameters

Longer Term
- Maybe add sound? 3D sound of collisions? 
- Make a wiki/better documentation page
- Add inputs to the world by the user: I was thinking an object with accelerometer/magnetometer/orientationMeter 
	could act as an input and a "virtual" version of the object in the engine which can interact with the 
	world's objects
- Joystick to toggle a vehicle in the "world"?
