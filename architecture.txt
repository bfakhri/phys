// Description of the files of this project


main.cpp	- Contains default glut redefined functions
		- Calls glutmainloop()
		- idle() in specific drives everything outside of the glut main loop
		- Will contain the vector of shapes!

draw.h/cpp	- Contains functions that draw shapes passed to it

shape.h/cpp	- Defines the shape class 
		- Need to decide how static (how much functionality) will be in this file

			- Probably the more the better
		- Subclasses of Shape must provide these functions:
			- volume
			- moment of inertia
			- density? 

phys.h/cpp	- Defines the main physics loop that updates the states of the shapes in a vector passed to it
			- Collision detection/resolution etc
			- Must communicate with main in order to have fluid environment access from UI


mather.h	- Declares structures used for math throughout the project like the cartesian struct

Information pathways:

main ---> phys		// main drives each step of physics loop
			// settings are sent to physics loop such as turning gravity on/off and world-wrapping
