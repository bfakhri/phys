- Video Capture (for playing back non-realtime simulations in realtime)
- Take all sim parameters out of code an put into a params.txt file so we don't have to recompile every time we change it
- Scripting type functionality so I can quickly define where/how the objects will start

Longer Term
- Collision detection for arbitrarily shaped objects (will this be mega hard?)
- Maybe add sound? 3D sound of collisions? 
- Make a wiki/better documentation page
- Add inputs to the world by the user: I was thinking an object with accelerometer/magnetometer/orientationMeter 
	could act as an input and a "virtual" version of the object in the engine which can interact with the 
	world's objects
- Joystick to toggle a vehicle in the "world"? 

- Because OpenGL won't let us use glreadpixels, I'll use this hack instead. Screencapture timelapse:
